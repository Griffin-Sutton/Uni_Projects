/*
	As we are starting to get into more complex code, 
	it is better practice to avoid "using namespace std;" in header files.

	WHY?
	When you write "using namespace std;", you're telling the compiler:
	"make everything in std available without needing std::"
	That seems convenient, but in header files, this creates namespace pollution -
	you put all the names from std into the global scope. This increases the
	chance that something in your code (or another library you include) has
	the same name as something in std, causing name conflicts and confusing errors.
	For example, if you have a function or variable named "count" and you include
	<iostream>, there will be a conflict with std::count.

	Instead, we will use "using std::..." for the specific standard library
	components we need. This way, we avoid namespace pollution and make it
	clear which parts of the standard library we are using. It also still allows us
	to omit std:: for those specific components, which makes the code cleaner.
