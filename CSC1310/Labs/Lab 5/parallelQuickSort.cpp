	Filename: parallelQuickSort.cpp
	Author: April Crockett
	Date: 7/4/2025
	Purpose: To demonstrate using OpenMP to parallelize the quick sort algorithm.
	
	Compile: g++ -fopenmp parallelQuickSort.cpp -Wall
	
	Note: since Quick Sort uses the divide-and-conquer algorithm design technique,
	it is a great algorithm to be able to run in parallel.
	
	Credits: I got the list of 10000 movie titles for movies.txt from Kaggle at
	https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moazeldsokyx/imdb-top-10000-movies-dataset
	
	I then copied the movie titles several times into movies.txt to get 60,000 titles
	to be able to demonstrate the real power of speed-up with large data sets when
	parallelizing a vector.
